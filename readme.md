Active progress on this project includes the use of the lha command line archiving tool as most useful utility to have running.

The ACID500 is designed to boot and execute a selection of classic amiga binaries without the need of a proprietary Kickstart ROM. Exec and dos.library are both implemented on native side of the emulation architecture.
