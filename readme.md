Latest milestone - ACID500 sucessfully hosts Hisoft genam assembling a fresh build of Sibly's finest source - Blitz2 - basic compiler of champions.

Active progress on this project includes the use of the lha command line archiving tool as most useful utility to have running.

Current research is AmigaDOS lock behavior as possibly cause of lha tool write failures. [recent log file](MyACID500/log/lhaskid4.log)
