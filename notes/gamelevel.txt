# THIS IS ALL JUST IDEAS FOR ELABORATION ON A THE CONCEPTS WE WILL DEVELOP AND HAVE.
Player will forage in dungeon style levels. These levels will be randomly generated from a pool of:
 - Mob types/agression
 - Coins
 - Assorted loot
 - Dopamine producing loot boxes with a wheel loot allocation feature.
 - Style and structures of the biomes, landscapes and perhaps related debuffs/buffs - Could be item specific/mob specific.
    - With this in mind, we can effectively reskin enemies easily by just relation to the areas in which they are found.
 - Colourful, friendly and basic graphics utilizing a majority of bold and engaging colour pallets.
 # To travel from area to area there should be requirements. 
  - In some areas as mentioned there will be different mobs, effects, loot and so forth.
  - Some areas will be allocated safe zones.
    - Campfire from darksouls esq idea for travel?
  - Some areas will be allocated exploration zones.
  - Perhaps some areas will be arenas where you will be battling another player/npc that has a similar power score as yourself.
  - Some areas will have waves of enemies that you must beat to proceed, providing loot.
  - There will be boss battles that will drop good loot.
