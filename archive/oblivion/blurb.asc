welcome to oblivion! keyboard controls: [ctrl] = up ; [left shift] = down ;
[left alt] = reverse ;
[.] = thrust ; [/] = fire ; [right shift] = shield ; [space bar] = smart bomb. extra
smart bomb and shield awarded every 10000 points.

what to do...

prevent scouts from stealing humanoids from the planet surface. if a scout
successfully steals a humanoid, he will attempt to carry it to the 'red zone'.
any humanoid who comes in contact with the red zone will instantly be transformed
into a highly dangerous mutoid. falling humanoids may be caught for bonus points,
and returned to the 'blue zone' for a further bonus. never return a humanoid
to the red zone! you begin the game with 10 humanoids to protect, and are awarded
a fresh set of humanoids upon the completion of every fifth wave.
warp gates are available
to get you around the planet surface faster. warp gates may also be used to time travel
forward 3 attack waves, by flying through the warp gate while carrying at least
4 humanoids.

oblivion is dedicated to the arcade classics 'Defender' & 'StarGate', and various
decent home computer adaptations, eg: 'Guardian' (on the C64), 'DataStorm'
(Yeah! Wild!), and 'cybernetix'.
