Re:	Introduction to Acid Virtual Machine


Dear Sirs,

Please find attached an introduction to the Acid Virtual Machine which also includes some background on my company and some technical information which I hope makes some sense to somebody at your end.

I am interested in promoting to your company the concept that Java based technology is destined to become a powerful development technology for the video game industry.

I am aware that Sun Microsystems have already done some preparatory work in this area for the Dreamcast platform but firmly believe a demonstration of our high speed, real time engine will reverse any negative impressions of the technology you may have gained from their efforts.

I look forward to your reply,

Yours Sincerely,
